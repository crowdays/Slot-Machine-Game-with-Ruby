Name: Slot Machine Game with Ruby
Date: 2/23/23
Creator: Lorenzo Juarez

Description:
This program simulates a slot machine game using the Ruby programming language.
It defines the symbols for the slot machine, the board layout, and the pay table.
The program also defines a spin function, which randomly generates a new board and displays it on the screen.
The game loop allows the player to spin the slots and win coins based on the pay table. The player's balance is
updated after each spin and displayed on the screen.
Technologies Used:
This program was written in Ruby.

Challenges Faced:
One challenge faced during the development of this program was designing an appropriate pay table that provided
a fair and interesting game experience. Another challenge was implementing the game loop and handling user input.
These were overcome by researching common pay tables for slot machines and experimenting with different approaches.

Future Improvements:
Future improvements to this program could include adding sound effects or animations to the slot machine spin,
allowing the player to bet different amounts of coins, and adding additional symbols or pay lines to the game.

How to Use:
To use this program, simply run the "slot_machine.rb" file in a Ruby environment. The program will display the
current balance and prompt the player to spin the slots or exit the game. The player can spin the slots by typing
's' and pressing enter. The program will generate a new board and display the results on the screen. The player
will win coins if the board matches one of the combinations in the pay table.
